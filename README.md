# Hangman-Game

This project is a console-based implementation of the classic Hangman game, developed in Python. 
It incorporates modular design principles by separating concerns into distinct files for game logic 
(main), word data (hangman_words), and visual art (hangman_art). The game randomly selects a word 
from a predefined list and prompts the player to guess one letter at a time, displaying progress with 
each input. The player has 6 lives, visually represented using ASCII art, which decrement with incorrect 
guesses. The program handles repeated guesses gracefully and provides real-time feedback until the player 
either successfully guesses the word or runs out of lives. This project demonstrates proficiency in control 
flow, string manipulation, list operations, and user interaction in Python, while emphasizing clean code 
structure and a smooth user experience.
